# Library List Creator


- Log into the library website and navigate to the checked out books section
- Right click and select **save as** to save the list as an html file.
- Run the library_list.py script and select all the html files to load into a list (navigate to repository and type ./library_list.sh)
- Copy and paste the output.  The suggested solution is to paste it into a to-do list app

**Note:** Multiple html files can be saved and loaded in one run of the script as long as the html files are not overwritten in the consecutive "save as" steps
